Going into the midterms, the Republicans control the Senate with 51 Republican Senators, compared to 49 Democratic Senators, and the Republicans control the House of Representatives, with 235 Republican Representatives, compared to 193 Democratic Representatives. 

Michael Montella's forecast is that Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives, and Republicans will not only maintain control of the Senate but also expand their present majority. Specifically, after the 2018 midterms, Democrats will control approximately 225 House seats but only 48 Senator seats. In North Dakota, Senator Heidi Heitkamp will lose her seat to Republican nominee Kevin Cramer. 

The underlying rationale is that historically the Senate is more insulated to short-term public opinion trends than the House of Representatives. The House's greater susceptibility to public whim will give Democrats a powerful surge to a sizeable majority, as a consequence of the prolonged public discontent toward President Trump and invigoration of the female electorate.
